// Package job provides the core job scheduling, execution, and management framework for go-job.
//
/*
go-job is a flexible and extensible job scheduling and execution library for Go. It enables you to register, schedule, and manage jobs with arbitrary function signatures, supporting custom executors, priorities, and advanced scheduling options such as cron expressions and delayed execution.

The library provides robust job observation features, including state and log history tracking, as well as customizable response and error handlers. With support for distributed storage backends, `go-job` is suitable for both local and distributed environments, making it ideal for building scalable, reliable job processing systems in Go applications.
